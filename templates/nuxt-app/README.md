# <ProjectName> Nuxt App

Frontend template for LeiCraftMC projects.

## Stack

- Nuxt 4 (`app/` srcDir)
- NuxtUI v4 + Tailwind v4 (CSS-first)
- Bun runtime
- Biome formatter/linter
- AGPL-3.0

## Setup

```bash
bun install
cp example.env .env
# Default port 12510 (package.json + example.env). Give each app its own port — see docs/02 — Ports.
bun run dev
```

## API client

Generate the typed client from the backend's OpenAPI spec. The backend (backend-service template)
must be running on port 12500 with its docs enabled:

```bash
bun run api-client:generate   # openapi-ts
```

## Frontend

The template ships a complete app shell. Delete whatever your project doesn't need.

| Route | Layout | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `default` | Marketing landing page (hero, features, how-it-works, CTA) |
| `/auth/login`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password` | `auth` | Login and password reset |
| `/auth/signup` | `auth` | Signup form, **UI only**: the backend has no register route yet |
| `/welcome` | `onboarding` | One-time onboarding after the first login |
| `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/settings/security`, `/dashboard/apikeys` | `dashboard` | Overview, profile, password/account deletion, API keys |
| `/dashboard/admin/users` | `dashboard` | Admin-only user management |

Who may open what is set by the constants at the top of `app/middleware/auth.global.ts`:
`HOME_ROUTE`, `PROTECTED_PREFIXES`, `ADMIN_PREFIXES`, `PUBLIC_ROUTES`, `ONBOARDING_ROUTE` and
`REQUIRE_ONBOARDING`.

Trimming it down:

- **Everything behind login (no public landing page):** set `PROTECTED_PREFIXES = ["/"]` and
  `HOME_ROUTE = "/"`, and replace `pages/index.vue` with your app's home (for example the dashboard
  overview).
- **No dashboard:** delete `layouts/dashboard.vue`, `pages/dashboard/` and `components/dashboard/`,
  remove the Dashboard links from `components/layout/Header.vue` and `Footer.vue`, and point
  `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` at your protected pages.
- **No onboarding:** set `REQUIRE_ONBOARDING = false`, or delete `pages/welcome.vue`,
  `layouts/onboarding.vue`, `composables/stores/useOnboardingStore.ts` and the onboarding block in
  the guard.
- **No signup:** delete `pages/auth/signup.vue` and its link in `pages/auth/login.vue`.
- **No admin area:** delete `pages/dashboard/admin/`, the Admin group in `layouts/dashboard.vue` and
  the "Manage Users" entry in `components/dashboard/UserMenu.vue`.

Placeholders to replace: `ProjectName` (texts, SEO titles, logo), `<PREFIX>` (session cookie name
in `composables/useAppCookies.ts`), and the links in `components/layout/Footer.vue`.
